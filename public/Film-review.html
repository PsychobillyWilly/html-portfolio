<h1>The Best films According to John</h1>
<h2>My Favourite Films</h2>
<hr  />
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>A thrilling fantasy anime film steeped in Japanese folk lore.<br  />
Very entertaining, family friendly and action packed.</p>
<h3>Neverending Story</h3>
<p>Another family friendly anime film that takes you away 
into a fantasy land where not much else seems to matter 
for the duration of the film.</p>
<h3>Kill Bill</h3>
<p>In stark contrast to the previous 2 films Kill Bill is quite
gory and sensational with lots of gratuitous violence but in a 
typically Quentin Tarrantino style he's managed to make it quite 
comical and surreal.</p>
<h3>Boon Dock Saints</h3>
<p>A funny look at gangland in Glasgow with some hillarious yet 
bloodthirsty moments. Starring Billy Connolly at his comedic best.</p>
