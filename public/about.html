<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am John, a uniquely creative designer and developer with over 15 minutes of experience. 
  I primarily focus on learning how to do it.
</p>

<p>I have a background in drinking lots of tea and coffee, eating cake, stroking cats and going for walks.</p>

<p> I am the first of my family since the dawn of HomoSapiens 300,000 years ago who have taken to website
   development, mostly because websites didn't exist prior to December 1990, when Sir Tim Berners-Lee 
   created the first one. This was the year before my father died. I plan to leave traces in the silicon 
   of many computers from here on. </p>
